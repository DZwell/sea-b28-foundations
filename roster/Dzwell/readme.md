# Daniel Zwelling

**About me:**	

I'm Daniel. I moved to Seattle in July from Columbus Ohio and love it so far. That mountain is something else. I got my degree in Jazz performance from The Ohio State University. I lead my own wedding/events band where I play drums. I also play piano for ballet classes, and I teach both drum and piano lessons. I'm really excited to start class, learn cool stuff, and meet cool new people.
